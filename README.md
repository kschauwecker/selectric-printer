# IBM Selectric Network Printer
This is an ongoing project to convert an IBM Selectric III electromechanical typewriter into a working network printer. It will consist of a set of solenoids that are linked through 3D-printed parts with the the typewrites mechanisms. A custom circuit board controls the solenoids, which features an RP2040 micro controller and a Raspberry Pi Compute Module.

Have a look at my other typewriter projects to get an idea what this will be like:
